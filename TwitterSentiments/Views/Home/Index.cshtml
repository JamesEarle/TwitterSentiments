        <h2>How This Works</h2>
        <p>
            In the "Make Request" tab you are able to provide a Twitter username, as well as a number. This number 
            tells the application how many of that user's tweets you want to be analyzed. Once those tweets are collected, 
            they are formatted into JSON and passed to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/text-analytics-api">Microsoft Cognitive Services API for text analytics</a>,
            specifically for sentiment analysis. This API also provides tools for language detection and key phrase analysis.
